# mucol_plotting_scripts

## For plotting macros

TBD

## For plotting with python notebooks

**For analysis in a python notebook with uproot/awkward arrays only**
- I manage packages with homebrew, and used it to install anaconda 
- I install packages for anaconda like ```conda install -c conda-forge vector```
- Start a notebook with 
```
jupyter notebook
```

**If you want to use a python notebook with ROOT**
- Start a notebook with 
```
root --notebook
```
